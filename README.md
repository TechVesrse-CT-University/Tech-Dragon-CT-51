Description: 
The Smart Assessment Board is a dynamic digital learning platform that aims to make quizzes and assessments not just more engaging, but also more efficient. By blending educational content with AI support, it creates a well-rounded learning experience. The platform includes a secure login system that confirms student identities using enrollment IDs, passwords, and even optional camera verification. Once students are logged in, they can dive into various quizzes—like the one on Indian States & Capitals—and receive instant feedback, along with access to a helpful chatbot for any guidance they might need. The dashboard gives students a straightforward view of their progress and performance metrics, while the quiz interface showcases questions in a clean and user-friendly way. With the chatbot assistant on hand, the platform becomes even more interactive and supportive, allowing students to clarify questions or rules without stepping out of the assessment environment. This system seems tailor-made for educational institutions eager to modernize their assessment methods with secure, interactive, and AI-enhanced testing tools.
